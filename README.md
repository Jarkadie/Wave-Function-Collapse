# Wave-Function-Collapse
A crude implementation of the wave function collapse algorithim as showed of in https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse
As of 7/14/2022 tiles and their adjacencies are hard coded as opposed to finding patterns in a given image and constructing a larger one

**Tiles used:**

## Milestones
- 7/14/2022 - A functional version is completed.
  - Works ideally from 2x2 - 7x7 ranges
  - When encountering an unsolvable state it restarts the algorithim
